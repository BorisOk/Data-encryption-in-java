# Data-encryption-in-java
Working with asymmetric cryptography. Each participant who will exchange messages
generates 2 keys. We distribute the public key to all friends. Using this key they can
encrypt messages for you. But only you can decrypt it using the private key.
It turns out safe and you don't need to transfer the secret key to anyone.
No one will decipher the message not having your private secret key.
